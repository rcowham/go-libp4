# p4go
Go interface library to use Perforce Helix Core command line (p4 or p4.exe)

This is a fork of Robert Cowhams great work https://github.com/rcowham/go-libp4 but he doesn't seem to be taking pull requests and aside from fixing bugs I wanted to add code for parsing results from each command instead of leaving it up to the end user. Also I renamed it p4go, like all their other api's :)
